# What I am building 
**I am building a national centralised patient portal**

# What I have done so far
- Built initial UX pages for patient portal
- Was using some initial CRUD

# What I need now
- Build the rest of the UX pages for patient portal
- Read the project proposal documentation and understand the scope of the project
- Read the document in Dev/national_centralised_patient_portal_proposal.md
- However, this time do not use actual CRUD but use mock data via json files

# Why do I need to do this?
- I need to demo the entire concept to the client
- I can always do the actual CRUD later on
