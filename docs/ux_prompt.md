# What I am building 
**I am building a national centralised patient portal**

# What I have done so far
- Built initial UX pages for patient portal
- Was using some initial CRUD

# What I need now
- Build the rest of the UX pages for patient portal
- Read the project proposal documentation and understand the scope of the project
- Read the document in Dev/national_centralised_patient_portal_proposal.md
- However, this time do not use actual CRUD but use mock data via json files

# Current Situation and Needs
- I need a simple way of including CRUD operations in the patient portal for demonstration purposes
- I am currently hosting it on GitHub Pages
- I need a way to add dynamic data to the patient portal
- Can I use sqlite? or some kind of local storage that can easily and reliably work with JavaScript?
- The Data Access code or Layer should be structured in a way that I can use it for accessing a MySQL database as well
- The sqlite database or local storage option is for demo purposes only
- It should actually be a flag in the JavaScript code that can be set to use either sqlite or MySQL
