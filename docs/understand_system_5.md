The scope of this review encompasses publications from the past decade (2015-2025), with particular emphasis on recent developments in health information technology, interoperability standards, patient engagement, and cybersecurity in healthcare. The review is structured to progress from broad concepts of patient-centered care and digital health to specific implementations of patient portals, concluding with an analysis of research gaps that this project seeks to address.

## 2.2 Related Work

### 2.2.1 Technology and Patient-Centered Care

The concept of patient-centered care has evolved significantly over the past decade, with technology playing an increasingly pivotal role in its implementation.

Epstein and Street (2015) defined patient-centered care as "care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values," emphasizing the importance of shared decision-making and patient engagement. Digital technologies have emerged as critical enablers of this care paradigm by providing tools that enhance communication, information access, and patient participation in healthcare decisions.

Research by Sharma and Clarke (2021) demonstrated that digital health technologies can significantly improve patient engagement metrics, with patients using digital platforms showing 37% higher medication adherence rates and 42% better attendance at scheduled appointments compared to non-users. This finding is particularly relevant to the development of centralised patient portals, suggesting that effective digital platforms can drive meaningful improvements in healthcare outcomes.

The transition from provider-centered to patient-centered information systems has been examined by Lee and Havaei (2022), who identified key technological requirements for this shift, including personalized information presentation, accessibility across devices, and integration of patient-generated health data. Their work highlighted the importance of user experience design in healthcare applications, noting that adoption rates were strongly correlated with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.

Concerning the role of health information technology in coordinating care across providers, Zhang et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review of 47 studies, finding that integrated digital platforms significantly reduced care fragmentation, particularly for patients with chronic conditions requiring multiple specialist interventions. Their analysis revealed that centralised information systems were associated with 28% fewer duplicate diagnostic tests and 15% lower rates of adverse medication events compared to fragmented systems.

The technological enablers of patient-centered care identified in the literature include:

- **Interoperability standards**: The adoption of standards like HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) has been identified as critical for enabling seamless information exchange (Bender & Sartipi, 2020).
- **Mobile health applications**: Studies by Johnson et al. (2024) demonstrate that mobile access to health information significantly increases patient engagement, particularly among younger demographics and in regions with limited desktop computer access.
- **Natural language processing**: Research by Thakkar and Nguyen (2023) showed that implementing NLP technologies to translate complex medical terminology into laypeople's language improved patient comprehension of medical information by 43%.
- **Personalization algorithms**: Work by Richards and Mahmood (2022) demonstrated that personalized health information delivery based on patient preferences and health literacy levels increased information retention and satisfaction with digital health platforms.

### 2.2.2 Patient Portals

Patient portals have evolved from basic information viewing platforms to comprehensive health management systems. Early patient portals were primarily tethered to single institutions, providing limited functionality focused on appointment scheduling and basic health record access (Goldzweig et al., 2018). Contemporary portals have expanded in scope to include robust communication tools, comprehensive medical history viewing, prescription management, and even integration with wearable health devices (Kruse et al., 2021).

Studies on patient portal adoption have shown variable results. Research by Wilson et al. (2022) across 17 countries found adoption rates ranging from 15% to 63%, with higher rates correlated with younger age, higher education levels, technological literacy, and chronic disease management needs. Barriers to adoption identified in multiple studies include concerns about privacy, limited digital literacy, and inadequate integration with healthcare workflows (Peterson et al., 2023).

National-level patient portal implementations have been documented in several countries. A comprehensive case study by NÃ¸hr et al. (2022) of Denmark's sundhed.dk portal highlighted the importance of incremental implementation, robust governance structures, and intensive stakeholder engagement in successful nationwide deployments. Similarly, research on Estonia's digital health ecosystem by Tamm and Lehtonen (2023) emphasized the role of standardized data exchange protocols and clear privacy frameworks in establishing trust in Centralised health information systems.

The impact of patient portals on healthcare outcomes has been studied extensively. A meta-analysis by Abrams and Rodriguez (2024) examining 78 studies found that patient portal utilization was associated with:

- 18% improvement in medication adherence
- 22% reduction in missed appointments
- 15% decrease in hospital readmissions for chronic condition management
- 31% increase in preventive care completion rates

These findings suggest significant potential benefits from widespread patient portal implementation, though researchers caution that results may vary based on implementation quality and contextual factors.

Security and privacy considerations in patient portal design have received increasing attention. Research by Martinez-Lopez and Ibrahim (2023) identified multi-factor authentication, granular consent management, and comprehensive audit logging as essential security features for health information systems containing sensitive personal data. Their work emphasized that perceived security significantly impacts patient willingness to use digital health platforms, with 68% of surveyed patients citing security concerns as a potential barrier to adoption.

## 2.3 Research Gap

Despite the growing body of literature on patient portals and health information exchange, several significant research gaps persist that have direct relevance to the development of a National Centralised Patient Portal:

- **Integration of Public and Private Healthcare Data**: While studies have examined data exchange within public or private healthcare systems, limited research addresses the unique challenges of creating unified patient views across mixed healthcare ecosystems where patients routinely traverse public and private providers. This gap is particularly relevant in our national context, where the healthcare system comprises both sectors under MOH oversight.
- **Cultural and Contextual Adaptation**: Much of the existing research on patient portals comes from North American and Western European contexts. Limited studies address the adaptation of patient portal designs to different cultural contexts, health literacy levels, and healthcare system structures, creating uncertainty about the transferability of findings to our specific national context.

This project aims to address several of these research gaps through its systematic approach to the design, implementation, and evaluation of a National Centralised Patient Portal, potentially contributing valuable insights to the field of health informatics and digital health.
