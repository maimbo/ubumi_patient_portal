## 1.4 Scope of Study

This project encompasses the following scope:

- **System Analysis and Design**: Comprehensive analysis of user requirements, system architecture, and integration points with existing healthcare information systems.
- **Core Functionality Development**:

1. Patient authentication and profile management
2. Medical records integration and visualization
3. Appointments tracking
4. Test results access

- **Integration Framework**: Development of APIs and interoperability protocols to facilitate data exchange between the portal and existing systems at healthcare providers.
- **User Interface Design**: Creation of responsive web and mobile interfaces optimized for accessibility and ease of use across diverse patient populations.
- **Security Framework**: Implementation of multi-layered security measures including encryption, access controls, audit trails, and compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.
- **Administrative Dashboard**: Development of analytics and oversight capabilities for the MOH to monitor system performance, usage patterns, and healthcare delivery metrics.
- **Evaluation and Testing**: Usability testing, security assessment, performance evaluation, and pilot implementation with selected healthcare providers and patient groups.
- **Out of Scope**:
- Direct modification of existing healthcare provider systems
- Direct(actual) access or integration to actual/existing Health Management Information Systems like SmartCare and others(\* this will of course be simulated)
- Development of clinical decision support tools
- Implementation of telemedicine consultation capabilities
- Financial and billing systems integration
