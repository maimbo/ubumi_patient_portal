## 1.2 Statement of the Problem

The current healthcare information landscape is characterized by fragmentation and dispersion across multiple providers and systems, creating significant challenges for both patients and healthcare administrators:

- **Information Fragmentation and Lack of Autonomous Access**:
  - Patients typically interact with multiple healthcare providers throughout their healthcare journey, resulting in their medical records being scattered across different institutions with limited or no communication between these systems.
  - However, even in instances where there is significant information sharing between these systems, this information is typically only accessed by health practitioners and very rarely do patients actively have independent access to their own records.
  - Patients do not have access to their :- complete medical history, test results, treatment plans, and appointments.
  - The fragmentation and lack of active patient involvement impedes continuity of care and creates barriers to comprehensive treatment planning.
- **Inefficient Communication Channels**: Communication between patients and healthcare providers often relies on traditional methods such as phone calls or physical appointments, resulting in delays, misunderstandings, and inefficient use of healthcare resources.
- **Appointment Management Challenges**: The absence of a centralised scheduling system forces patients to navigate different appointment systems for various providers, leading to scheduling conflicts, missed appointments, and administrative inefficiencies.
- **Duplication of Diagnostic Tests**: Without access to comprehensive medical histories, healthcare providers may unnecessarily repeat diagnostic tests, increasing costs and subjecting patients to redundant procedures.
- **Uncoordinated Care Delivery**: The MOH faces significant challenges in effectively coordinating patient care across providers due to the lack of integrated information systems, hampering its ability to implement population health management initiatives and ensure equitable service delivery.
- **Inconsistent Patient Experience**: The quality of digital services varies significantly across healthcare providers, creating inconsistent experiences and variable levels of service accessibility for patients.
- **Data Security and Privacy Concerns**: The current fragmented approach to health information management raises concerns regarding data security, privacy protection, and compliance with national and international data protection regulations.

The absence of a unified national patient portal perpetuates these challenges, undermining the healthcare system's efficiency, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness. This project aims to address these problems through the development of a comprehensive centralised patient portal that integrates information and services across the healthcare ecosystem.

## 1.3 Objective

The primary aim of this project is to design and develop a National Centralised Patient Portal that provides unified access to healthcare information and services across all providers under the coordination of the Ministry of Health.

The specific objectives are:

1. To create a single, comprehensive digital platform that integrates patient information from multiple healthcare providers across both public and private sectors.
2. To develop a user-friendly interface that enables patients to securely access their complete medical records, appointment schedules, test results, and treatment plans.
3. To implement robust communication channels between patients and healthcare providers, facilitating seamless information exchange and service delivery.
4. To ensure compliance with national data protection regulations and international best practices in health information security and privacy.
5. To evaluate the effectiveness of the portal through rigorous user testing and performance assessment against established metrics for usability, security, and functionality.
6. To create a scalable and adaptable system architecture that can accommodate future technological advancements and evolving healthcare needs.
