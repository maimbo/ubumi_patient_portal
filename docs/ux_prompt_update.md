# What I am building 
**I am building a national centralised patient portal**

# What I have done so far
- Built initial UX pages for patient portal
- Was using some initial CRUD

# What I have done so far
- Built the main UX pages for patient portal
- Pages have static placeholders for data

# What I need you
- Analyse pages in the static folder
- Enhance pages by adding login by different providers
- Remember providers will enter details related to same patient and finally patient views details
- For instance, different providers will manager appointments and other medical records of patient.
- Read the project proposal documentation and understand the scope of the project
- Read the document in docs/national_centralised_patient_portal_proposal.md
- Create json files for each page and place mechanism to edit the json data in file to simulate CRUD operations
