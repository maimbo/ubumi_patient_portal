The project implementation will involve - systematic requirements analysis, security-focused design, and user-centered development methodology, that aims to adequately address the current fragmentation in healthcare information systems, thereby empowering patients with greater control over their health information. The project aims to ensure that the portal meets stakeholders' needs while adhering to international best practices in health informatics and data protection. The NCPP stands to revolutionize healthcare delivery by improving coordination between providers, enhancing patient engagement, reducing administrative inefficiencies, and ultimately contributing to better health outcomes across the population.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background of Study

Globally, healthcare systems are undergoing continual digital transformation to improve service delivery, enhance patient experiences, and optimize resource utilization. Primarily, Electronic Health Record(EHR) and Health Management Information systems are in the forefront of this constant transformation. The typical scenario is that various health providers use health information systems procured from different vendors of their choice. This results in each healthcare provider maintaining separate records of the same patients, leading to fragmentation, duplication, and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.

In response to these challenges, there has been an emergence of centralised patient portals, offering patients unified access to their health information. In their early stages, patient portals were usually implemented at institutional levels, covering a number of health institutions. Over time, patient portals have evolved towards broader integration and coverage, right to national levels. Countries like Estonia, Denmark, and Singapore have pioneered nationwide health information exchanges that allow patients to access their medical records across different healthcare providers through single digital platforms.

In the Zambian context, the healthcare landscape consists of a diverse mix of public and private providers operating under the oversight of the Ministry of Health (MOH). While digitization efforts have been undertaken across various institutions, these implementations have largely progressed independently, resulting in heterogeneous systems with limited interoperability.

The proposed NCCP would greatly enable the MOH, in executing its mandate as the central healthcare coordinator, by providing the Zambian citizenry and residents with a single unified patient portal that integrates information across all providers to facilitate comprehensive patient-centered care.

This project aims to build upon the foundation Zambia’s Digital Health Strategy (2022-2026) that is focused on leveraging digital technologies to improve health outcomes, achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and support broader sustainable development goals, particularly SDG 3.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem

The current healthcare information landscape is characterized by fragmentation and dispersion across multiple providers and systems, creating significant challenges for both patients and healthcare administrators:

- **Information Fragmentation and Lack of Autonomous Access**:
  - Patients typically interact with multiple healthcare providers throughout their healthcare journey, resulting in their medical records being scattered across different institutions with limited or no communication between these systems.
  - However, even in instances where there is significant information sharing between these systems, this information is typically only accessed by health practitioners and very rarely do patients actively have independent access to their own records.
  - Patients do not have access to their :- complete medical history, test results, treatment plans, and appointments.
  - The fragmentation and lack of active patient involvement impedes continuity of care and creates barriers to comprehensive treatment planning.
- **Inefficient Communication Channels**: Communication between patients and healthcare providers often relies on traditional methods such as phone calls or physical appointments, resulting in delays, misunderstandings, and inefficient use of healthcare resources.
- **Appointment Management Challenges**: The absence of a centralised scheduling system forces patients to navigate different appointment systems for various providers, leading to scheduling conflicts, missed appointments, and administrative inefficiencies.
- **Duplication of Diagnostic Tests**: Without access to comprehensive medical histories, healthcare providers may unnecessarily repeat diagnostic tests, increasing costs and subjecting patients to redundant procedures.
- **Uncoordinated Care Delivery**: The MOH faces significant challenges in effectively coordinating patient care across providers due to the lack of integrated information systems, hampering its ability to implement population health management initiatives and ensure equitable service delivery.
- **Inconsistent Patient Experience**: The quality of digital services varies significantly across healthcare providers, creating inconsistent experiences and variable levels of service accessibility for patients.
- **Data Security and Privacy Concerns**: The current fragmented approach to health information management raises concerns regarding data security, privacy protection, and compliance with national and international data protection regulations.

The absence of a unified national patient portal perpetuates these challenges, undermining the healthcare system's efficiency, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness. This project aims to address these problems through the development of a comprehensive centralised patient portal that integrates information and services across the healthcare ecosystem.

The review establishes the theoretical foundations for the development of a National Centralised Patient Portal while identifying gaps in current knowledge and practice that this project aims to address. The literature explored spans peer-reviewed academic publications, industry white papers, government reports, and case studies of similar implementations globally. By systematically analyzing this body of knowledge, this review provides context for the project's approach, informs design decisions, and highlights best practices and potential pitfalls in the development of nationwide patient portal systems.

The scope of this review encompasses publications from the past decade (2015-2025), with particular emphasis on recent developments in health information technology, interoperability standards, patient engagement, and cybersecurity in healthcare. The review is structured to progress from broad concepts of patient-centered care and digital health to specific implementations of patient portals, concluding with an analysis of research gaps that this project seeks to address.

## 2.2 Related Work

### 2.2.1 Technology and Patient-Centered Care

The concept of patient-centered care has evolved significantly over the past decade, with technology playing an increasingly pivotal role in its implementation.

Epstein and Street (2015) defined patient-centered care as "care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values," emphasizing the importance of shared decision-making and patient engagement. Digital technologies have emerged as critical enablers of this care paradigm by providing tools that enhance communication, information access, and patient participation in healthcare decisions.

Research by Sharma and Clarke (2021) demonstrated that digital health technologies can significantly improve patient engagement metrics, with patients using digital platforms showing 37% higher medication adherence rates and 42% better attendance at scheduled appointments compared to non-users. This finding is particularly relevant to the development of centralised patient portals, suggesting that effective digital platforms can drive meaningful improvements in healthcare outcomes.

The transition from provider-centered to patient-centered information systems has been examined by Lee and Havaei (2022), who identified key technological requirements for this shift, including personalized information presentation, accessibility across devices, and integration of patient-generated health data. Their work highlighted the importance of user experience design in healthcare applications, noting that adoption rates were strongly correlated with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.

Concerning the role of health information technology in coordinating care across providers, Zhang et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review of 47 studies, finding that integrated digital platforms significantly reduced care fragmentation, particularly for patients with chronic conditions requiring multiple specialist interventions. Their analysis revealed that centralised information systems were associated with 28% fewer duplicate diagnostic tests and 15% lower rates of adverse medication events compared to fragmented systems.

The technological enablers of patient-centered care identified in the literature include:

- **Interoperability standards**: The adoption of standards like HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) has been identified as critical for enabling seamless information exchange (Bender & Sartipi, 2020).
- **Mobile health applications**: Studies by Johnson et al. (2024) demonstrate that mobile access to health information significantly increases patient engagement, particularly among younger demographics and in regions with limited desktop computer access.
- **Natural language processing**: Research by Thakkar and Nguyen (2023) showed that implementing NLP technologies to translate complex medical terminology into laypeople's language improved patient comprehension of medical information by 43%.
- **Personalization algorithms**: Work by Richards and Mahmood (2022) demonstrated that personalized health information delivery based on patient preferences and health literacy levels increased information retention and satisfaction with digital health platforms.

### 2.2.2 Patient Portals

Patient portals have evolved from basic information viewing platforms to comprehensive health management systems. Early patient portals were primarily tethered to single institutions, providing limited functionality focused on appointment scheduling and basic health record access (Goldzweig et al., 2018). Contemporary portals have expanded in scope to include robust communication tools, comprehensive medical history viewing, prescription management, and even integration with wearable health devices (Kruse et al., 2021).

Studies on patient portal adoption have shown variable results. Research by Wilson et al. (2022) across 17 countries found adoption rates ranging from 15% to 63%, with higher rates correlated with younger age, higher education levels, technological literacy, and chronic disease management needs. Barriers to adoption identified in multiple studies include concerns about privacy, limited digital literacy, and inadequate integration with healthcare workflows (Peterson et al., 2023).

National-level patient portal implementations have been documented in several countries. A comprehensive case study by Nøhr et al. (2022) of Denmark's sundhed.dk portal highlighted the importance of incremental implementation, robust governance structures, and intensive stakeholder engagement in successful nationwide deployments. Similarly, research on Estonia's digital health ecosystem by Tamm and Lehtonen (2023) emphasized the role of standardized data exchange protocols and clear privacy frameworks in establishing trust in Centralised health information systems.

The impact of patient portals on healthcare outcomes has been studied extensively. A meta-analysis by Abrams and Rodriguez (2024) examining 78 studies found that patient portal utilization was associated with:

- 18% improvement in medication adherence
- 22% reduction in missed appointments
- 15% decrease in hospital readmissions for chronic condition management
- 31% increase in preventive care completion rates

These findings suggest significant potential benefits from widespread patient portal implementation, though researchers caution that results may vary based on implementation quality and contextual factors.

Security and privacy considerations in patient portal design have received increasing attention. Research by Martinez-Lopez and Ibrahim (2023) identified multi-factor authentication, granular consent management, and comprehensive audit logging as essential security features for health information systems containing sensitive personal data. Their work emphasized that perceived security significantly impacts patient willingness to use digital health platforms, with 68% of surveyed patients citing security concerns as a potential barrier to adoption.

## 2.3 Research Gap

Despite the growing body of literature on patient portals and health information exchange, several significant research gaps persist that have direct relevance to the development of a National Centralised Patient Portal:

- **Integration of Public and Private Healthcare Data**: While studies have examined data exchange within public or private healthcare systems, limited research addresses the unique challenges of creating unified patient views across mixed healthcare ecosystems where patients routinely traverse public and private providers. This gap is particularly relevant in our national context, where the healthcare system comprises both sectors under MOH oversight.
- **Cultural and Contextual Adaptation**: Much of the existing research on patient portals comes from North American and Western European contexts. Limited studies address the adaptation of patient portal designs to different cultural contexts, health literacy levels, and healthcare system structures, creating uncertainty about the transferability of findings to our specific national context.

This project aims to address several of these research gaps through its systematic approach to the design, implementation, and evaluation of a National Centralised Patient Portal, potentially contributing valuable insights to the field of health informatics and digital health.

## 2.4 Summary

This literature review has examined the existing body of knowledge regarding patient portals, health information exchange, and patient-centered digital healthcare. The review reveals a maturing field with increasing standardization around interoperability frameworks, growing evidence for the clinical and operational benefits of patient portals, and evolving best practices in security, privacy, and user experience design.

Several key themes emerge from the literature that will inform the development of the National Centralised Patient Portal:

- **Evidence of Impact**: Research consistently demonstrates that well-designed patient portals can positively impact healthcare outcomes, patient engagement, and operational efficiency, providing strong justification for nationwide implementation.
- **Adoption Challenges**: Multiple studies highlight the importance of addressing barriers to adoption including privacy concerns, digital literacy limitations, and equitable access considerations.
